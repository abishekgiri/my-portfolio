          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a strong focus on backend systems, applied machine learning, and data-driven
            problem solving. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and research, where I design
            systems
            that prioritize reliability, scalability, and measurable impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience building end-to-end machine learning pipelines, backend services, and research-oriented
            projects that emphasize correctness, performance, and reproducibility. My projects often involve working
            with
            real-world datasets, implementing evaluation metrics, and translating experimental results into practical
            system
            designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside development, I am deeply interested in how large software systems fail, how they can be tested
            more
            effectively, and how data and machine learning can be used to improve software reliability. This interest
            has
            guided my independent research work in areas such as bug prediction, benchmarking, and applied ML for
            decision-making systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aim to pursue advanced study in software engineering and related fields, with long-term interests in
            scalable
            systems, testing, and applied AI. I value clarity over complexity, systems over scripts, and long-term
            engineering principles over short-term trends.
